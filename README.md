# TPCDI
BDMA-DW-TPCDI Project

In order to make all the scripts have the same path pattern for the input files, you should create a local "inputFiles" folder on the root of the project, to store all the generated TPCDI files (this folder and all the inputFiles will be ignored in our git version control). For instance, the Time.txt file woould be localte at ./inputFiles/Batch1/Time.txt
